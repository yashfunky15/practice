When Tableau connects to data, fields are assigned into two roles:

---> Dimensions and Measures


Types of Charts

Line — View trends in data over time.
Bar — Compare data across categories.
Heat Map — Show the relationship between two factors.
Highlight Table — Shows detailed information on heat maps.
Treemap — Show hierarchical data as a proportion of a whole.
Gantt — Show duration over time. 
Bullet — Evaluate performance of a metric against a goal. 
Scatterplot — Investigate relationships between quantitative values.
Histogram — Understand the distribution of your data. 
Symbol maps — Use for totals rather than rates. Be careful, as small differences will be hard to see.
Area maps — Use for rates rather than totals. Use sensible base geography.
Box-and-Whisker — Show the distribution of a set of a data.
